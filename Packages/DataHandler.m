Here modelname is a string, which may include a formal ID and a desciption of the model. It has to appear first.
The remaining items may appear in arbitrary order, and any additional list items are ignored.
maxmin is not an array, but a string containing either "max" or "min"
to indicate whether the objective should be minimized or maximized. 
It is optional, the default is taken as maximisation. 

From within Mathematica, having created the individual arrays somehow, produce the file  by executing:

  Switch[maxmin, -1, "max", 1, "min", _, "max"]}, "List"];
